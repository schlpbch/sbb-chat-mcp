## ✅ Phase 3 Achievements

### Multi-Tool Orchestration (100%)

1. **Context Management**
   - ✅ `ContextManager` implemented in `src/lib/llm/contextManager.ts`
   - ✅ Session ID generation and persistence
   - ✅ User preference tracking (eco-friendly, family-friendly, budget)
   - ✅ Intent extraction and entity recognition
   - ✅ Conversation history management

2. **Planning Orchestrator**
   - ✅ `PlanningOrchestrator` in `src/lib/llm/orchestrator.ts`
   - ✅ Multi-step tool plan execution
   - ✅ Dependency resolution with template variables
   - ✅ Parallel tool execution
   - ✅ Result aggregation and synthesis

3. **Itinerary Generation**
   - ✅ Complete itinerary data model
   - ✅ Preference-aware route optimization
   - ✅ Eco-scoring and cost tracking
   - ✅ Timeline-based visualization
   - ✅ `ItineraryCard` component with interactive UI

### Testing Infrastructure (100%)

1. **25-Question Evaluation Framework**
   - ✅ Comprehensive test suite covering all MCP tools
   - ✅ Automated Playwright tests for quality assurance
   - ✅ 6 intelligent categories (Journey Planning, Real-Time, Stations, Eco, Weather, Accessibility)
   - ✅ Success rate tracking and reporting

2. **Component Test Coverage**
   - ✅ Context Manager tests
   - ✅ Orchestrator tests
   - ✅ All card components tested (Trip, Weather, Station, Board, Eco, Itinerary)
   - ✅ API route tests
   - ✅ Error handling and edge case tests

### UI Enhancements (100%)

1. **Rich Message Cards**
   - ✅ StationCard - Station and place information
   - ✅ TripCard - Journey results with timing
   - ✅ WeatherCard - Weather forecasts
   - ✅ BoardCard - Real-time arrivals/departures
   - ✅ EcoCard - Environmental impact comparison
   - ✅ ItineraryCard - Multi-step travel plans

2. **Interactive Features**
   - ✅ Cross-component map interactivity
   - ✅ Tool execution feedback with animations
   - ✅ Loading states and error handling
   - ✅ Accessibility improvements (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

### Known Issues (2026-01-01)

1. **Voice Output**
   - ⚠️ TTS returns "ok" instead of meaningful summaries when voice + rich mode enabled
   - Root cause: Orchestration prompt instructs brief responses for visual cards
   - Status: Fix attempted but rolled back due to server error

2. **Multilingual Support**
   - ⚠️ System responds in English to non-English messages (Chinese, Hindi, etc.)
   - Root cause: Fixed UI language setting, no auto-detection from message content
   - Status: Fix attempted but rolled back due to server error

3. **UI Language Persistence**
   - ⚠️ Language selection not saved when navigating home → chat
   - Root cause: Home page doesn't persist to localStorage
   - Status: Minor UX issue, separate fix needed

   - Add "Ask AI about this" buttons to map markers
   - Implement trip route visualization on map

3. **UX Enhancements**
   - Chat persistence with localStorage
   - Streaming responses for better UX
   - Voice input support
   - Export itineraries (PDF/Calendar)

### Medium-Term Goals

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Response caching for common queries
   - Query optimization and deduplication
   - Bundle size optimization

2. **Production Readiness**
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Monitoring and analytics integration
